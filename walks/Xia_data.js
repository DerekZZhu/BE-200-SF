Starting from the cruise center and finally Guanyin Mountain Beach, along Yundang Lake, Xianyue Mountain and many others, the trail connects important ecological nodes and parks in Xiamen Island, forming a walking corridor for citizens as a significant public space in contemporary Xiamen. The starting point of the trail is marked with a spiral slope.",
